A text-normalization toolkit for Chinese
================================

Want a text normalizing for Chinese texts? Here it is!

Forked from https://github.com/soshial/text-normalization which is too out of dated.

Typical features of mods:
------------------
- Support Chinese now.
- Replace old numword with [num2words](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/num2words), which receives better support with more and more languages.
- Update `num_*.py` and add `num_zh.py` to work with new added num2words.
- Remove dependency of regex, nltk and MySQL, you can run `normalization.py` which is much easier to setup.

Any problem, feel free to contact me ^_^
